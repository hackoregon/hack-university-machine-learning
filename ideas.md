Ideas for HUML Class

- lecture on data, cleaning preprocessing, aquiring, project selection
- survey the class on operating system, language knowledge, math/education and start helping students build data set for predicting class performance
- live quizzes during class with [slack quizbot](https://github.com/codebyfire/slackquizbot)
- twitter bot to follow hashtags from the class and collate results from questions/topics
- get students to log a GPS track with MyTracks (or an iPhone app)
- reuse old material by me and others
  - [weather prediction with pybrain](http://slides.com/hobsonlane/pycon2015-predict-weather-with-pybrain#/)
  - [neural net lecture at Little Bird]
  - bitcrawl
  - twip
